                         <p class="post-content">You heard me... Here's what happened. <br><br>
                        I was sitting in science class, minding my own business, when suddenly,<br>
                    this HUUUUGE kid, seven feet tall, came up behind me and grabbed my shirt.<br>
                He pulled me into the air, and bashed my head against the wall a few times.<br>
            Granted, i'm also a big kid so i am hardly injured.<br><br>
        Now, when i get up and brush the dust of my shirt, I'm mad as hell.<br>
    This idiot can't just do that! I grabbed my AK-47 out from under my jacket,<br>
And started pelting the jerk with bullets, and they bounced right off of him.<br>
It was too late for me, because i was shooting, he had started sprinting towards me.<br>
He whacked me into the wall behind me (yet fucking again) and this time,<br>
We both smashed through into another classroom.<br><br>
Then the principal came into the room...<br>
AND STARTED BLOWING EVERYTHING UP! HE TOOK OUT THIS FRICKIN HUGE RPG AND<br>
ANNIHILATED THE ENTIRE SCHOOL!<br><br>
In the end, it was only the three of us left... This random cat came by,<br>
and was all like, "Meow". For some reason the principal and the other kid just exploded after that.<br>
THE END.</p>
